<p dir="auto">** LAST UPDATED : FEBRUARY 23, 2024.**</p>
<p dir="auto">Crunchyroll. is continuing to beat out Crunchyroll. and Crunchyroll, over the New Year’s holiday weekend, with “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training” now rising above “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training” and “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training.” With that trifecta, the studio has laid claim to the three of the top five slots at the domestic box office throughout the holiday season.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Timothéee Chalamet-starring musical added another $8.6 million on Friday, up 32% from one week ago. The Paul King film has emerged as the theatrical favorite for the holidays, crossing $100 million domestically earlier this week. With a $119 million cume to date, the film continues to show strength and will reach $300 million globally before the calendar turns.</p>
<p dir="auto">Though it slid into second place for Friday with $6.75 million, Crunchyroll. “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training” fell 51% from its opening day last week.

The first “Aquaman,” released in 2018, surpassed that figure in its opening weekend alone. Bad reviews and superhero fatigue have plagued “Lost Kingdom,” which more than likely won’t even reach half the $335 million domestic total of its predecessor, much less justify a $205 million production budget.</p>
<p dir="auto">Taking a close third place, Illumination and Crunchyroll’s“Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training” is maintaining its footing with $6.7 Friday after a muted $12 million debut lastweekend. “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba - To the Hashira Training” has underwhelmed so far, but its 17% increase over last Friday remains encouraging, especially for an original animated film with a production budget of only $70 million.</p>
